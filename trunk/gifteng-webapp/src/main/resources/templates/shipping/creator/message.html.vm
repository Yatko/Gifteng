	    Here is the pre-paid, pre-addressed USPS shipping label for <a href="${baseUrl}/#/browse?view=${ad.id}">${ad.adData.title}</a> that was requested on Gifteng! Whoohoo!
	    Please ship the gift as soon as possible. $!{receiver.userData.getFirstName()} is eagerly waiting to get it.<br /><br />

            Note: Use any plain envelope or box, but please do not use Priority Mail packaging because they wonâ€™t work with your prepaid label.

    	Happy giving & receiving,<br />
